# PyTorch_Getting_Started

This code is my personal process in going through the PyTorch "Learn the Basics" tutorial that is features on the PyTorch website.

The tutorial was written by Suraj Subramanian, Seth Juarez, Cassie Breviu, Dmitry Soshnikov, and Ari Bornstein so all of the credit should go to them.

The code here was typed out pretty much line for line according to the tutorial with only small changes to formatting and/or variable renaming.

The same goes for the comments, taking passages from the tutorial in whole and rewriting anything that made more sense to me.

The following is a link to the tutorial: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/intro.html
